# Uber Supply-Demand Gap | Assignment

Introduction

This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving this assignment will give  an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA and data visualisation. 

Business Understanding

You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?
Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. 

As an analyst, you decide to address the problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue. 

Business Objectives

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

Data Understanding

Only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Identify the data quality issues and clean the data so that you can use it for analysis.
Ensure that the dates and time are in the proper format. Derive new variables which will be useful for analysis.

Results Expected

1. Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
2. Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
  Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
  Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
3. What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
4. Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
